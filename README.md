# Coursera Machine Learning Exercises

This Repop holds the solutions to some of the programming exercises to Andrew NG's Machine Learning course on Coursera. The code is a combination of the skeleton code that is provided during the course and my solutions to the problems that are asked as part of the course. The code can be run in either Octave or Matlab.
